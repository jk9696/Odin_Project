        <!-- Important Html Sectioning -->
        <header>
        <nav>
        <main> <!--main includes the article, section, and div elements-->
        <article>
        <section> 
        <div>
        <aside> <!-- this is also often placed inside main as well-->
        <footer>

          <!-- <main> is for content unique to this page. Use <main> only once per page, and put it directly inside <body>. Ideally this shouldn't be nested within other elements.
          <article> encloses a block of related content that makes sense on its own without the rest of the page (e.g., a single blog post).
          <section> is similar to <article>, but it is more for grouping together a single part of the page that constitutes one single piece of functionality (e.g., a mini map, or a set of article headlines and summaries). It's considered best practice to begin each section with a heading; also note that you can break <article>s up into different <section>s, or <section>s up into different <article>s, depending on the context.
          <aside> contains content that is not directly related to the main content but can provide additional information indirectly related to it (glossary entries, author biography, related links, etc.).
          <header> represents a group of introductory content. If it is a child of <body> it defines the global header of a webpage, but if it's a child of an <article> or <section> it defines a specific header for that section (try not to confuse this with titles and headings).
          <nav> contains the main navigation functionality for the page. Secondary links, etc., would not go in the navigation.
          <footer> represents a group of end content for a page.

        <p>There once was a man named O'Dell<br>
          Who loved to write HTML<br>
          But his structure was bad, his semantics were sad<br>
          and his markup didn't read very well.</p>

<hr> <!-- here hr is literally a horzontal line that seperates two paragraphs-->
<p>Meanwhile, Harry was sitting at home, staring at his royalty statement and pondering when the next spin off series would come out, when an enchanted distress letter flew through his window and landed in his lap. He read it hazily and sighed; "better get back to work then", he mused.</p>
